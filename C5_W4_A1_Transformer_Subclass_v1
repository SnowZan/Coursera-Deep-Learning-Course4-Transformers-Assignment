1 - Positional Encoding
In sequence to sequence tasks, the relative order of your data is extremely important to its meaning. When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model. However, when you train a Transformer network, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful - you can specifically encode the positions of your inputs and pass them into the network using these sine and cosine formulas:
P
E
(pos,2i)
=sin(
pos
10000
2i
d


)
(1)
(1)PE(pos,2i)=sin(pos100002id)

P
E
(pos,2i+1)
=cos(
pos
10000
2i
d


)
(2)
(2)PE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos100002id)
d
d
is the dimension of the word embedding and positional encoding
pos
pos
is the position of the word.
i
i
refers to each of the different dimensions of the positional encoding.
The values of the sine and cosine equations are small enough (between -1 and 1) that when you add the positional encoding to a word embedding, the word embedding is not significantly distorted. The sum of the positional encoding and word embeding is ultimately what is fed into the model. Using a combination of these two equations helps your Transformer network attend to the relative positions of your input data. Note that while in the lectures Andrew uses vertical vectors but in this assignment, all vectors are horizontal. All matrix multiplications should be adjusted accordingly.

Nice work calculating the positional encodings! Now you can visualize them.
In [75]:
pos_encoding = positional_encoding(50, 512)

print (pos_encoding.shape)

plt.pcolormesh(pos_encoding[0], cmap='RdBu')
plt.xlabel('d')
plt.xlim((0, 512))
plt.ylabel('Position')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()

(1, 50, 512)

 

Each row represents a positional encoding - notice how none of the rows are identical! You have created a unique positional encoding for each of the words.


2 - Masking
There are two types of masks that are useful when building your Transformer network: the padding mask and the look-ahead mask. Both help the softmax computation give the appropriate weights to the words in your input sentence.

2.1 - Padding Mask
Oftentimes your input sequence will exceed the maximum length of a sequence your network can process. Let's say the maximum length of your model is five, it is fed the following sequences:
[["Do", "you", "know", "when", "Jane", "is", "going", "to", "visit", "Africa"], 
 ["Jane", "visits", "Africa", "in", "September" ],
 ["Exciting", "!"]
]

which might get vectorized as:
[[ 71, 121, 4, 56, 99, 2344, 345, 1284, 15],
 [ 56, 1285, 15, 181, 545],
 [ 87, 600]
]

When passing sequences into a transformer model, it is important that they are of uniform length. You can achieve this by padding the sequence with zeros, and truncating sentences that exceed the maximum length of your model:
[[ 71, 121, 4, 56, 99],
 [ 2344, 345, 1284, 15, 0],
 [ 56, 1285, 15, 181, 545],
 [ 87, 600, 0, 0, 0],
]

Sequences longer than the maximum length of five will be truncated, and zeros will be added to the truncated sequence to achieve uniform length. Similarly, for sequences shorter than the maximum length, they zeros will also be added for padding. However, these zeros will affect the softmax calculation - this is when a padding mask comes in handy! You will need to define a boolean mask that specifies which elements you must attend(1) and which elements you must ignore(0). Later you will use that mask to set all the zeros in the sequence to a value close to negative infinity (-1e9). We'll implement this for you so you can get to the fun of building the Transformer network! 😇 Just make sure you go through the code so you can correctly implement padding when building your model.
After masking, your input should go from [87, 600, 0, 0, 0] to [87, 600, -1e9, -1e9, -1e9], so that when you take the softmax, the zeros don't affect the score.
The MultiheadAttention layer implemented in Keras, use this masking logic.
In [76]:
def create_padding_mask(seq):
    """
    Creates a matrix mask for the padding cells
    
    Arguments:
        seq -- (n, m) matrix
    
    Returns:
        mask -- (n, 1, 1, m) binary tensor
    """
    seq = 1 - tf.cast(tf.math.equal(seq, 0), tf.float32)
  
    # add extra dimensions to add the padding
    # to the attention logits.
    return seq[:, tf.newaxis, tf.newaxis, :] 
In [77]:
x = tf.constant([[7., 6., 0., 0., 1.], [1., 2., 3., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., 4., 5.]])
print(create_padding_mask(x))

tf.Tensor(

 [[[1. 1. 1. 0. 0.]]]


 [[[0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]]]], shape=(3, 1, 1, 5), dtype=float32)

If we multiply (1 - mask) by -1e9 and add it to the sample input sequences, the zeros are essentially set to negative infinity. Notice the difference when taking the softmax of the original sequence and the masked sequence:

print(tf.keras.activations.softmax(x))

2.2 - Look-ahead Mask
The look-ahead mask follows similar intuition. In training, you will have access to the complete correct output of your training example. The look-ahead mask helps your model pretend that it correctly predicted a part of the output and see if, without looking ahead, it can correctly predict the next output.
For example, if the expected correct output is [1, 2, 3] and you wanted to see if given that the model correctly predicted the first value it could predict the second value, you would mask out the second and third values. So you would input the masked sequence [1, -1e9, -1e9] and see if it could generate [1, 2, -1e9].
Just because you've worked so hard, we'll also implement this mask for you 😇😇. Again, take a close look at the code so you can effictively implement it later.

3 - Self-Attention
As the authors of the Transformers paper state, "Attention is All You Need".

Figure 1: Self-Attention calculation visualization
The use of self-attention paired with traditional convolutional networks allows for the parallization which speeds up training. You will implement scaled dot product attention which takes in a query, key, value, and a mask as inputs to returns rich, attention-based vector representations of the words in your sequence. This type of self-attention can be mathematically expressed as: 
 Attention (Q,K,V)=softmax(
Q
K
T
d
k
−
−
√

+M)V 
(4)
(4) Attention (Q,K,V)=softmax⁡(QKTdk+M)V 
Q
Q
is the matrix of queries 
K
K
is the matrix of keys
V
V
is the matrix of values
M
M
is the optional mask you choose to apply 
d
k
dk
is the dimension of the keys, which is used to scale everything down so the softmax doesn't explode

Exercise 3 - scaled_dot_product_attention
Implement the function `scaled_dot_product_attention()` to create attention-based representations
Reminder: The boolean mask parameter can be passed in as none or as either padding or look-ahead. Multiply (1. - mask) by -1e9 before applying the softmax.
Additional Hints
You may find tf.matmul useful for matrix multiplication.

The Transformer Encoder layer pairs self-attention and convolutional neural network style of processing to improve the speed of training and passes K and V matrices to the Decoder, which you'll build later in the assignment. In this section of the assignment, you will implement the Encoder by pairing multi-head attention and a feed forward neural network (Figure 2a). 
Figure 2a: Transformer encoder layer
MultiHeadAttention you can think of as computing the self-attention several times to detect different features. 
Feed forward neural network contains two Dense layers which we'll implement as the function FullyConnected
Your input sentence first passes through a multi-head attention layer, where the encoder looks at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. The outputs of the multi-head attention layer are then fed to a feed forward neural network. The exact same feed forward network is independently applied to each position.
For the MultiHeadAttention layer, you will use the Keras implementation. If you're curious about how to split the query matrix Q, key matrix K, and value matrix V into different heads, you can look through the implementation. 
You will also use the Sequential API with two dense layers to built the feed forward neural network layers.


In [83]:
def FullyConnected(embedding_dim, fully_connected_dim):
    return tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(fully_connected_dim, activation='relu'),  # (batch_size, seq_len, dff)
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(embedding_dim)  # (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
    ])


4.1 Encoder Layer
Now you can pair multi-head attention and feed forward neural network together in an encoder layer! You will also use residual connections and layer normalization to help speed up training (Figure 2a).

Exercise 4 - EncoderLayer
Implement EncoderLayer() using the call() method
In this exercise, you will implement one encoder block (Figure 2) using the call() method. The function should perform the following steps:
You will pass the Q, V, K matrices and a boolean mask to a multi-head attention layer. Remember that to compute self-attention Q, V and K should be the same.
Next, you will pass the output of the multi-head attention layer to a dropout layer. Don't forget to use the training parameter to set the mode of your model. 
Now add a skip connection by adding your original input x and the output of the dropout layer. 
After adding the skip connection, pass the output through the first layer normalization.
Finally, repeat steps 1-4 but with the feed forward neural network instead of the multi-head attention layer.
Additional Hints:
The __init__ method creates all the layers that will be accesed by the the call method. Wherever you want to use a layer defined inside the __init__ method you will have to use the syntax self.[insert layer name]. 
You will find the documentation of MultiHeadAttention helpful. Note that if query, key and value are the same, then this function performs self-attention.

4.2 - Full Encoder
Awesome job! You have now successfully implemented positional encoding, self-attention, and an encoder layer - give yourself a pat on the back. Now you're ready to build the full Transformer Encoder (Figure 2b), where you will embedd your input and add the positional encodings you calculated. You will then feed your encoded embeddings to a stack of Encoder layers.

Figure 2b: Transformer Encoder

Exercise 5 - Encoder
Complete the Encoder() function using the call() method to embed your input, add positional encoding, and implement multiple encoder layers
In this exercise, you will initialize your Encoder with an Embedding layer, positional encoding, and multiple EncoderLayers. Your call() method will perform the following steps:
Pass your input through the Embedding layer.
Scale your embedding by multiplying it by the square root of your embedding dimension. Remember to cast the embedding dimension to data type tf.float32 before computing the square root.
Add the position encoding: self.pos_encoding [:, :seq_len, :] to your embedding.
Pass the encoded embedding through a dropout layer, remembering to use the training parameter to set the model training mode. 
Pass the output of the dropout layer through the stack of encoding layers using a for loop.

5 - Decoder
The Decoder layer takes the K and V matrices generated by the Encoder and in computes the second multi-head attention layer with the Q matrix from the output (Figure 3a).

Figure 3a: Transformer Decoder layer

5.1 - Decoder Layer
Again, you'll pair multi-head attention with a feed forward neural network, but this time you'll implement two multi-head attention layers. You will also use residual connections and layer normalization to help speed up training (Figure 3a).

Exercise 6 - DecoderLayer
Implement DecoderLayer() using the call() method
Block 1 is a multi-head attention layer with a residual connection, dropout layer, and look-ahead mask.
Block 2 will take into account the output of the Encoder, so the multi-head attention layer will receive K and V from the encoder, and Q from the Block 1. You will then apply a dropout layer, layer normalization and a residual connection, just like you've done before. 
Finally, Block 3 is a feed forward neural network with dropout and normalization layers and a residual connection.
Additional Hints:
The first two blocks are fairly similar to the EncoderLayer except you will return attention_scores when computing self-attention

5.2 - Full Decoder
You're almost there! Time to use your Decoder layer to build a full Transformer Decoder (Figure 3b). You will embedd your output and add positional encodings. You will then feed your encoded embeddings to a stack of Decoder layers.

Figure 3b: Transformer Decoder

Exercise 7 - Decoder
Implement Decoder() using the call() method to embed your output, add positional encoding, and implement multiple decoder layers
In this exercise, you will initialize your Decoder with an Embedding layer, positional encoding, and multiple DecoderLayers. Your call() method will perform the following steps:
Pass your generated output through the Embedding layer.
Scale your embedding by multiplying it by the square root of your embedding dimension. Remember to cast the embedding dimension to data type tf.float32 before computing the square root.
Add the position encoding: self.pos_encoding [:, :seq_len, :] to your embedding.
Pass the encoded embedding through a dropout layer, remembering to use the training parameter to set the model training mode. 
Pass the output of the dropout layer through the stack of Decoding layers using a for loop.

6 - Transformer
Phew! This has been quite the assignment, and now you've made it to your last exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization. Congratulations! You've done all the hard work, now it's time to put it all together.

Figure 4: Transformer
The flow of data through the Transformer Architecture is as follows:
First your input passes through an Encoder, which is just repeated Encoder layers that you implemented:
embedding and positional encoding of your input
multi-head attention on your input
feed forward neural network to help detect features
Then the predicted output passes through a Decoder, consisting of the decoder layers that you implemented:
embedding and positional encoding of the output
multi-head attention on your generated output
multi-head attention with the Q from the first multi-head attention layer and the K and V from the Encoder
a feed forward neural network to help detect features
Finally, after the Nth Decoder layer, two dense layers and a softmax are applied to generate prediction for the next output in your sequence.

Exercise 8 - Transformer
Implement Transformer() using the call() method
Pass the input through the Encoder with the appropiate mask.
Pass the encoder output and the target through the Decoder with the appropiate mask.
Apply a linear transformation and a softmax to get a prediction.
